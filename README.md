- 👋 Hi, I’m @surrealspiderman
- 👀 I’m interested in creating technology which bolsters the environment and strengthens human connection to their nature.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning go, tigergraph/gsql, rust, and javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on tools which strengthen communication and aren't ultimately going to be sold to the highest bidder.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
